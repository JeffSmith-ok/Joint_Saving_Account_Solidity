# Module_20_Challenge

## Joint Savings Account

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I will create a solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.

The Starting file provided for this challenge contains a `pragma` for solidity version `5.0.0`.
I will do the following:

1. Create and work within a local blockchain development environment using the JavaScript VM provided by the Remix IDE.

2. Script and deploy a **JointSavings** smart contract.

3. Interact with your deployed smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds.

The images proving execution results are as follows:
